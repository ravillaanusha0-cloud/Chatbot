# Chatbot
This project presents the design and development of a web-based chatbot using the Django framework. The chatbot allows users to communicate through a simple and user-friendly interface by entering text queries and receiving automated responses.
The system is developed using Python and Django for backend processing, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the frontend interface. The chatbot processes user input, generates appropriate responses, and displays them dynamically on the web page. The application demonstrates how web frameworks can be integrated with basic artificial intelligence concepts to create interactive systems.
This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of chatbot implementation, web application development, and client-server interaction. The chatbot can be further enhanced by integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and voice-based interaction, making it suitable for real-world applications such as customer support and information systems.
